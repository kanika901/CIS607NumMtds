This project is imported from https://github.com/hopelessoptimism/happy-healthy-hungry and would be extended to accomplish the future goals listed by this project.
I would develop and implement a linear regression model. This model would be used to  perform a linear regression on historic data on past inspections combined with scores from other 'similar' restaurants.
